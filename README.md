This project servers as an exmaple on how to build an `MVT` architecture application with **Next.js** and **Supabase**

>  What is Next.js ?
- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

> What is Supabase ?
- [Supabase Docs](https://supabase.com/docs) - learn about the Supabase platform.
- [Learn Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/examples) - a collection of your setp-by-step guides on how to get started with your framework of choice

    ```

2. Setup your Supabase credentials. Follow the getting started guide with JavaScript [Supabase Guide](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/supabase-client) and get your API `URL` and `KEY`.

4. Create a `.env.local` file and set the respective .env keys with their values wit
    ```bash
    touch .env.local
    ```

    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_API_URL=`...enter your Supabase API URL here`

    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY_API_KEY=`...enter your Supabase anon key here`

3. Install the project dependencies
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server

- ***lib*** directory

The above folder contains resuable modules & helper function sharable by the whole prject

- ***pages*** directory

> In Next.js, a page is a React Component exported from a .js, .jsx, .ts, or .tsx file in the pages directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name 

\- Next.js Documentation

Using the `MVC` architecure, you can consider a page as a combination of a `view` & `controller`. This is where you implement your design, layout & the fetching of your data from a remote resource e.g API

- ***public*** directory

This folder is used to serve static assets. eg logos, favicons (browser tab icons), fonts, tracking libraries i.e `Google Analytics` or `Hotjar`

- ***styles*** directory

Custom `CSS` or `SCSS` file are all placed under this folder. Next.js Comes with an in-built CSS and SCSS handling. After you have written your styling, it can be reference directly in your React components

- ***.env.local*** file

Store all your application *sensitive* configurations here. Service keys e.g `Facebook integration key` and `Supabase API key`. If hardcoded in yoour application directly, malicious people or hackers with access to the repo will use them with unintended consequences.

The reset of the root file are automatically generated by tools e.g `NPM`, `Eslint`, & `create-next-app`.  and are used to store custom configurations & project dependencies.

## Deployment
The application has been hosted on the  [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the same creators of Next.js.

> Remember to setup your .env variables within the vercel app that's is created.
